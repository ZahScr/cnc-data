### Outstanding questions

#### Users
- Does CNC work as a gateway to iNaturalist app usage?
- Of the new users who joined in each year, how many of them first observed during/near CNC?
- We should look at it by each year (re-start)
    - should we start april first?
- Segment users into users who participated in CNC (EACH YEAR) vs not (define participation)
    - Did they make an observation during cnc dates (see doc)
    - 2 segments per year: CNC participants and non-participants
        - What are the average observations per user for each group (before and after cnc)
        - What are the average species per user for each group (before and after cnc)
- If a user observed during CNC, we want to know how active they were later in the year/future?
    - In comparison to other users
    - Does their usage trail off?

#### Species
- Which species observations have had the greatest lift/drop YoY?
- Which species have had significant observation location changes YoY?
- Which species observations are increasing/declining?
- Species distributions over time?

### Chart ideas

- When people are making observations of specific family (kingdom)
    - pie chart what kingdom are we observing most (all time)
    - stacked bar graph by kingdom (week or month)
- Count the number of observations by species all time order by rarest
    - Get species name
    - Use a table (color coded)
- quality_grade is research grade vs casual vs ? (check other categories)
    - table with number of observations
    - captive cultivated = people maintain it (count and percentage of total observations)
- Unique metrics per CNC event for comparison, etc
