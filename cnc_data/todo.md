# Does CNC work as a gateway to iNaturalist app usage?

# - of the new users who joined in each year, how many of them first observed during/near CNC?

# - we should look at it by each year (re-start)
#   - should we start april first?

# - segment users into users who participated in CNC (EACH YEAR) vs not (define participation)
#   - did they make an observation during cnc dates (see doc)
#   - 2 segments per year: CNC participants and non-participants
#       - what are the average observations per user for each group (before and after cnc)
#       - what are the average species per user for each group (before and after cnc)
# - observations per user per week as a bar chart, weeks on x, y on rate

# - if a user observed during CNC, we want how active they were later in the year/future?
#   - in comparison to other users
#   - does their usage trail off?

# - if we look at an entire year, should we do april to april?

# - when people are making observations of specific family (kingdom)
#   - stacked bar graph by kingdom (week or month)
#   - pie chart what kingdom are we observing most (all time)

# - count the number of observations by species all time order by rarest
#   - get species name
#   - use a table (color coded)

# - quality_grade is research grade vs casual vs ? (check other categories)
#   - table with number of observations
#   - captive cultivated = people maintain it (count and percentage of total observations)

# DONE - put more years on x-axis (all years)
# DONE - rename unique charts as NEW users and species
# DONE - add unique charts that do NOT count new
# DONE - export both PNG and SVG
# DONE - add annotations for CNC date

# Unique metrics per CNC event for comparison, etc
